## Write a program that 

1. <h2> Inputs a number n.
2. <h2> Creates an array of size n, with random values. 
3. <h2>Performs various sorting algorithms like bubble sort merge sort insertion sort selection sort,quick sort....
4. <h2>Outputs the time taken by each algorithm to sort created array.</h2>

**here i  calculate the time exexution for every sorting algotithm**
